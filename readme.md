# Shopping List

Shopping list application only made with vanilla JavaScript.

This project was created to focus on working with the DOM, events, state, local storage and other fundamentals of JavaScript.

You can:

- Add items to the list
- Remove single or all items
- Filter items
- Click on the items to edit them

The items will be saved in local storage so they don't get lost when reloading/closing the browser.
